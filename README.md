# 🌍 30 Day Map Challenge 2021

> The [#30DayMapChallenge](https://github.com/tjukanovt/30DayMapChallenge) was started by Topi Tjukanov

This repository hosts my code and contributions to the 2021 #30DayMapChallenge. My goal is to primarily use Python for each submission, and (where possible) to include datasets relevant to my daily work as a disaster risk analyst.
